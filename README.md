# GitHub Deployment Portal

An internal CI/CD dashboard for triggering, monitoring, and rolling back GitHub Actions
deployments — a React/Vite frontend backed by an ASP.NET Core API that talks to the
GitHub REST API on your behalf.

- `deployment-ui/` — React frontend (dashboard, deploy form, history, analytics, settings)
- `src/DeploymentAPI/` — ASP.NET Core backend (GitHub API integration, auth, settings storage)
- `src/AdminAPI/`, `src/PMSCoreAPI/`, `src/SecurityAPI/` — the sample services this portal deploys
- `.github/workflows/` — the CI/CD pipelines the portal triggers
BGF
No database is required — all configuration is stored in a local JSON file.

## Run Pipeline

[![Run Pipeline](https://img.shields.io/badge/Run%20Pipeline-GitHub%20Actions-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/VarshithChand/yaml/actions/workflows/run-pipeline.yml)

Click the button, then on the page it opens:

1. Click **Run workflow** (top right).
2. Pick the branch.
3. Pick an **environment** (`dev` / `staging` / `production`).
4. Pick a **project** (`AdminAPI` / `SecurityAPI` / `PMSCoreAPI`).
5. Click **Run workflow** to confirm.

A README can't execute YAML or hold a live form itself — this button just jumps to
GitHub's own real trigger page for [`run-pipeline.yml`](.github/workflows/run-pipeline.yml).
That workflow is currently a scaffold: it logs whichever branch/environment/project you
picked, but doesn't deploy anything yet — none of `dev`/`staging`/`production` map onto
this repo's actual deploy targets today. Each project's own *real* pipeline already
exists and does the actual work:

| Project | CI (builds automatically on push) | Release (manual, real deploy) |
|---|---|---|
| AdminAPI | [`admin.yml`](.github/workflows/admin.yml) | [`release-admin.yml`](.github/workflows/release-admin.yml) — see [src/AdminAPI/README.md](src/AdminAPI/README.md) |
| PMSCoreAPI | [`pmscore.yml`](.github/workflows/pmscore.yml) | [`Release PMSCore API.yml`](<.github/workflows/Release PMSCore API.yml>) |
| SecurityAPI | [`security.yml`](.github/workflows/security.yml) | [`Release Security API.yml`](<.github/workflows/Release Security API.yml>) |

Or trigger any of them the normal way, without a README button at all: the Deployment
Portal's own **Deploy** page, or GitHub's **Actions** tab directly.

**AdminAPI** also has its own standalone trigger page, hosted on GitHub Pages —
[https://varshithchand.github.io/yaml/admin-pipeline.html](https://varshithchand.github.io/yaml/admin-pipeline.html).
Pick Build or Release (with per-cluster checkboxes), a branch, and **Run Pipeline**
dispatches the real workflow right from that page. See
[docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for what it needs set up (Pages enabled, plus this
page's origin added to the backend's CORS allow list) before it'll work.

---

## 1. Install prerequisites

You need **.NET SDK 10** and **Node.js 20+**. Pick your OS below.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.10
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

Close and reopen your terminal after installing, then confirm:

```powershell
dotnet --version
node --version
npm --version
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
brew install node
```

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -O /tmp/dotnet-install.sh
chmod +x /tmp/dotnet-install.sh
/tmp/dotnet-install.sh --channel 10.0
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

You'll also want [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't already have it, and
optionally a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (scopes: `repo`,
`workflow`) — the portal works without one, but GitHub's API rate limit is 60 requests/hour
anonymous vs. 5,000/hour with a token.

---

## 2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VarshithChand/yaml.git
cd yaml
```

---

## 3. Run the Deployment Portal

Two terminals, both from the repo root.

**Terminal 1 — backend**
```bash
cd src/DeploymentAPI
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
Starts on **http://localhost:5279**.

**Terminal 2 — frontend**
```bash
cd deployment-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```
Starts on **http://localhost:5173**. Its dev server proxies `/api/*` to the backend
(configured in `deployment-ui/vite.config.js`), so open **http://localhost:5173** —
not the backend port — in your browser.

### First-run configuration

You don't need to hand-edit any config file to get started. Open the app, go to
**Settings**, and fill in:

- **GitHub Credentials** — repository URL (`https://github.com/owner/repo`) and, optionally,
  a Personal Access Token
- **GitHub OAuth Login** *(optional)* — client ID/secret from a
  [GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) if you want team members to
  log in with GitHub instead of using the portal anonymously. Set the app's callback URL to
  `http://localhost:5279/api/auth/github/callback`
- **Admin Allowlist** *(optional)* — GitHub usernames that should get the Admin role on login.
  Admin accounts (repo-admin on GitHub) are also the only ones who see the Release Approvals
  page, since that's the same permission GitHub itself requires to approve a deployment

These are written to `src/DeploymentAPI/appsettings.Local.json`, which is gitignored —
nothing you enter here ever gets committed.

---

## 4. Run it with Docker instead

One command, from the repo root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You don't need to fill in a repo/PAT here — once the containers are running,
open the app and use the "Connect your GitHub repository" popup on first
visit instead. Every visitor configures their own repo + token that way.

Then build and start both containers:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Frontend on **http://localhost:8081**, backend on `http://localhost:8080` (internal only) —
both containers sit on the same `portal-network` Docker network and reach each other by
service name (nginx proxies `/api/*` to `http://deployment-api:8080`). The frontend waits
for the backend's healthcheck to actually pass before it starts serving, so there's no
race where it comes up before the API is ready to answer. Settings saved through the UI
persist in the bind-mounted `src/DeploymentAPI/data/` directory, so they survive a rebuild.

---

## 5. The Docker images — pull them straight onto any VM

Everything above (sections 1-4) is for building on your own machine. This step is the
destination: two ready-made images, already built, sitting in a registry. Got a VM spun up
somewhere — AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure, GCP, a home server, doesn't matter which — with
Docker installed on it? You don't need to clone this repo or build anything there. Just
pull these two images and run them:

| | Image | Pull command |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend** | `ghcr.io/varshithchand/deployment-portal-api` | `docker pull ghcr.io/varshithchand/deployment-portal-api:latest` |
| **Frontend** | `ghcr.io/varshithchand/deployment-portal-ui` | `docker pull ghcr.io/varshithchand/deployment-portal-ui:latest` |

Both are rebuilt and re-published automatically by
[`.github/workflows/Docker Build and Push.yml`](.github/workflows/Docker%20Build%20and%20Push.yml)
every time `master` changes, so `:latest` always matches what's in this repo right now.

### 5a. If the packages are private (the default)

GHCR packages pushed by a workflow default to private. Either flip both to **Public** from
each package's **Package settings** on GitHub (then anyone can `docker pull` with no login),
or log in first with a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) that has
the `read:packages` scope:

```bash
docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME -p YOUR_PAT_WITH_read_packages_SCOPE
```

### 5b. Run them with Compose

Grab just this one file — [`docker-compose.prod.yml`](docker-compose.prod.yml) — no other
part of the repo is needed:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VarshithChand/yaml/master/docker-compose.prod.yml
```

No `.env` needed for a repo/PAT — connect to GitHub from inside the app itself
once it's running (see 5a).

Then:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Same result as [section 4](#4-run-it-with-docker-instead) — frontend on
**http://localhost:8081**, backend reachable internally at `deployment-api:8080` on the
`portal-network` bridge network — except Docker pulls both images from GHCR instead of
building them from source, and settings persist in a named `deployment-data` volume instead
of a bind-mounted folder.

### 5c. Or run them by hand, no compose file at all

```bash
docker network create portal-network

docker run -d --name deployment-api --network portal-network \
  -v deployment-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/varshithchand/deployment-portal-api:latest

docker run -d --name deployment-ui --network portal-network \
  -p 8081:8080 \
  ghcr.io/varshithchand/deployment-portal-ui:latest
```

Both containers land on the same `portal-network`, so nginx inside `deployment-ui` still
reaches `http://deployment-api:8080` by container name — exactly what Compose sets up
automatically in 5b, just spelled out by hand.

### On a cloud VM

The exact same commands from 5b or 5c work unchanged on a fresh VM on any provider — AWS
EC2, DigitalOcean, Azure, GCP, whatever — as long as Docker is installed and port **8081**
is open in that provider's firewall/security group. Then open
`http://YOUR_VM_PUBLIC_IP:8081`.

---

## 6. Deploying to AWS EC2

Runs the full stack — Portal + all three sample services — on a single EC2 instance via
`docker-compose.prod.yml` (section 5b), pulling pre-built images from GHCR instead of
building on the instance.

### 6a. Launch the instance

From the EC2 console (or equivalent CLI/Terraform):

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| AMI | Amazon Linux 2023 |
| Instance type | `t3.small` (2 vCPU / 2 GB — comfortable for 5 containers; `t3.micro` works but is tight) |
| Security group | Inbound: **22** (SSH, your IP only) and **8081** (HTTP, `0.0.0.0/0` or your IP) |
| Key pair | Any you have SSH access to |

### 6b. Bootstrap it

Either paste [`scripts/aws/ec2-setup.sh`](scripts/aws/ec2-setup.sh) into the instance's
**User data** field at launch (runs automatically as root on first boot), or SSH in after
it's up and run:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VarshithChand/yaml/master/scripts/aws/ec2-setup.sh | sudo bash
```

It installs Docker + the Compose plugin and pulls `docker-compose.prod.yml`. No `.env`
values to fill in for GitHub — connect from inside the app itself once it's running (see
5a). SSH in and start it:
```bash
cd /opt/deployment-portal
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Open `http://YOUR_EC2_PUBLIC_IP:8081`.

### 6c. If the GHCR packages are still private

Same situation as section 5a — either flip all five packages to Public in their GitHub
package settings, or `docker login ghcr.io` on the instance first with a PAT that has
`read:packages` before the `docker compose pull` step above.

### 6d. Redeploying after a new push

```bash
cd /opt/deployment-portal
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
Only containers whose image actually changed get recreated; the rest are left running.
Wiring this to run automatically (e.g. a GitHub Actions job that SSHes in after
`Docker Build and Push.yml` finishes) is a reasonable next step but isn't set up yet — this
is the manual version.

### 6e. About the Docker socket mount

`docker-compose.prod.yml` mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into `deployment-api` the same way
the build-from-source `docker-compose.yml` does, for the in-app **Docker** management page.
That's equivalent to giving the container root on the EC2 instance — it's admin-gated in the
app itself, but don't put the admin allowlist ([section 3](#first-run-configuration)) in
bootstrap mode (empty) on a publicly reachable instance, since bootstrap mode means anyone
can act as admin, including through that Docker page.

---

## 7. Deploying it for free (Fly.io + Cloudflare Pages)

The backend goes on **Fly.io** (free allowance includes a small persistent volume, so
saved Settings survive redeploys) and the frontend on **Cloudflare Pages** (free static
hosting). Since they end up on different domains, this isn't quite the same as local dev —
the frontend needs to know the backend's absolute URL at build time, and the two host
setup steps below (`fly deploy`, then the Pages dashboard) each depend on output from the
other, so do them in order.

### 7a. Deploy the backend to Fly.io

Install the CLI:
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
pwsh -Command "iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex"

# macOS / Linux
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
```

Log in (opens a browser):
```bash
fly auth login
```

`src/DeploymentAPI/fly.toml` is already set up (Docker build, persistent volume mounted
at `/data`, port 8080 matching the Dockerfile). Pick a globally-unique app name, put it in
that file's `app = "..."` line, then:

```bash
cd src/DeploymentAPI

fly apps create YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME

fly volumes create deployment_data --region iad --size 1 -a YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME

# a real signing secret for login sessions — without this the app still
# runs (it generates one on its own), but sessions won't survive a restart
fly secrets set Jwt__Secret="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" -a YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME

fly deploy -a YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME
```

Confirm it's up:
```bash
curl https://YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME.fly.dev/api/settings
```
should return an empty settings JSON, not an error.

### 7b. Deploy the frontend to Cloudflare Pages

This part's dashboard-only (Cloudflare doesn't have a "one command" path for a fresh
project). At [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Workers & Pages** →
**Create** → **Pages** → **Connect to Git** → pick this repo, then set:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Framework preset | Vite |
| Root directory | `deployment-ui` |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `dist` |

Under **Environment variables**, add:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME.fly.dev
```
(no trailing slash) — this is what makes the built frontend call your Fly.io backend
instead of expecting a same-origin `/api/*`. Save and deploy; Cloudflare gives you a
`https://your-project.pages.dev` URL.

### 7c. Point the backend's CORS at the new frontend URL

Back in a terminal:
```bash
fly secrets set Cors__AllowedOrigins__0=https://your-project.pages.dev -a YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME
```
(Setting a secret restarts the app automatically.) If you later add a custom domain in
Cloudflare, add it too as `Cors__AllowedOrigins__1`, and so on.

Open the `pages.dev` URL — first-run configuration works exactly as in
[section 3](#first-run-configuration), except settings now persist on the Fly.io volume
across redeploys instead of a local file.

**Using GitHub OAuth login in this setup** *(optional)* — the callback/frontend URLs for
OAuth aren't editable from the Settings page, only via config, so also set:
```bash
fly secrets set GitHubOAuth__CallbackUrl=https://YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME.fly.dev/api/auth/github/callback \
                GitHubOAuth__FrontendUrl=https://your-project.pages.dev \
                -a YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME
```
and set your GitHub OAuth App's callback URL to match the first value.

---

## 8. Running the sample services (optional)

`AdminAPI`, `PMSCoreAPI`, and `SecurityAPI` are the sample ASP.NET Core services this portal
deploys — you don't need them running to use the portal itself, but if you want to run one
locally:

```bash
cd src/AdminAPI      # or PMSCoreAPI / SecurityAPI
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| AdminAPI | http://localhost:5274 |
| PMSCoreAPI | http://localhost:5116 |
| SecurityAPI | http://localhost:5159 |
| DeploymentAPI | http://localhost:5279 |

Each also has its own `Dockerfile` now, and `docker compose up --build` (section 4) brings
all three up alongside the Portal itself — `admin-api` on **:8090**, `pmscore-api` on
**:8091**, `security-api` on **:8092**.

### Running everything at once, without Docker

Five separate `dotnet run`/`npm run dev` terminals gets old fast. Two shortcuts, both
starting DeploymentAPI + AdminAPI + PMSCoreAPI + SecurityAPI + the frontend together:

- **VS Code**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Tasks: Run Task` → **Run Everything (APIs + Frontend)**
  (see `.vscode/tasks.json` — there's also a narrower **Run All APIs** task that skips the
  frontend, if that's all you need)
- **Plain terminal (Windows/PowerShell)**: `.\run-all.ps1` from the repo root — opens one
  titled window per service so their output doesn't interleave, and each stops
  independently by closing its own window

### The Docker management page

With the Portal running via Compose (its backend needs `/var/run/docker.sock` mounted in —
already wired up in `docker-compose.yml`), open the **Docker** tab in the sidebar to see
every container/image/volume/network on that host, not just these three — start, stop,
restart, remove, view logs, or spin up a brand-new container from an image, right from the
UI. It's admin-gated the same way Settings and Approvals are (see section 3's admin
allowlist), since it can control anything running on the host, not only this portal's own
services.

To build everything in the repo at once instead of one project at a time:
```bash
dotnet build Demo-Patch-CICD.slnx
```

### The Services page doesn't need any of the above running

The Services page's "Users / Projects / Security" tabs (the sample admin-panel-style demo)
call `/api/admin/*`, `/api/pmscore/*`, and `/api/security/*` on DeploymentAPI itself —
DeploymentAPI has its own small in-memory copy of the same sample data (see
`Services/UserStore.cs`, `ProjectStore.cs`, `ApiKeyStore.cs`, `AuditLogStore.cs`), so that
page works out of the box wherever DeploymentAPI itself is reachable, with no separate
proxy, deployment, or CORS setup for AdminAPI/PMSCoreAPI/SecurityAPI required.

The three standalone projects above are unrelated to that page — they exist purely as real,
independently deployable sample apps for this portal's actual CI/CD pipelines to build and
release (the `Release Admin API` / `Release PMSCore API` / `Release Security API` workflows,
the Environments page defaults, `Docker Build and Push.yml`, etc.).

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Repository not found" / "Failed to save GitHub settings" even though everything looks
right** — the Vite dev server's proxy occasionally goes stale (most often after switching
git branches while it's running) and starts serving the frontend's own `index.html` instead
of forwarding `/api/*` to the backend. Stop the `npm run dev` process and start it again.

**Backend port already in use** — check for a lingering process
(`tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq DeploymentAPI.exe"` on Windows, `lsof -i :5279` on
macOS/Linux) and stop it before running `dotnet run` again; the previous process holds a
file lock that makes rebuilds fail.

**GitHub API errors like "rate limit exceeded"** — add a Personal Access Token in Settings
to raise the limit from 60 to 5,000 requests/hour.

**The Approvals page/tab isn't showing** — it's only visible to a token that has admin
access to the configured repo, since that's the permission GitHub requires to approve a
deployment. Check that the account behind your saved Personal Access Token is a repo admin.

**Deployed on Fly.io/Cloudflare Pages and API calls fail with a CORS error** — the backend
only allows origins listed in `Cors:AllowedOrigins`; confirm you ran the `fly secrets set
Cors__AllowedOrigins__0=...` step in [7c](#7c-point-the-backends-cors-at-the-new-frontend-url)
with your actual `pages.dev` URL (or custom domain).

**Deployed, but "Login with GitHub" doesn't keep you logged in** — this needs
`GitHubOAuth__CallbackUrl`/`GitHubOAuth__FrontendUrl` set to your real URLs (see the OAuth
note at the end of section 7), and it only works over HTTPS, which both Fly.io and
Cloudflare Pages give you by default — plain PAT-based usage doesn't need any of this.
